# Weather-Scraper

This is a web scraper I made for extracting weather data from Google.
The project is written in python, using the Beautiful Soup package and Requests library.
It takes input from the user for the desired location and temperature unit, then outputs the temperature and weather condition. 

## To-do List
- Upload new code that takes weather data for a city and puts into MySQL database (exception handling included)
- Update README accordingly
- Prepare to run program to analyze weather database at end of August
